## Future Improvements

While this project serves as a basic implementation of a RESTful API with CRUD operations, there are several areas where it could be further enhanced:

### 1. Testing Strategy
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
  - Implement a TDD approach to ensure that all features are thoroughly tested before they are implemented. This involves writing unit tests first, and then developing code that passes these tests.
  - Benefits include improved code quality, fewer bugs, and more maintainable code.

- **Unit Testing with XUnit:**
  - Integrate XUnit as the testing framework to write unit tests for the application.
  - Create tests for each service method (`GetAllUsersAsync`, `GetUserByIdAsync`, `AddUserAsync`, `UpdateUserAsync`, `DeleteUserAsync`) to ensure they behave as expected.
  - Mock dependencies like the `AppDbContext` using a mocking library such as Moq to isolate and test service logic without depending on the actual database.

- **Integration Testing:**
  - Develop integration tests to validate the interactions between different parts of the system, such as the `UsersController` and `UserService`.
  - Use an in-memory database provider (like `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory`) for testing the actual interaction between the service and the database without affecting the production database.

### 2. Database Optimization
- **Stored Procedures:**
  - Implement stored procedures in the database to handle complex queries or batch operations. This can help improve performance by reducing the amount of logic executed in the application layer and allowing the database to optimize query execution.
  - Example: Move the user-related operations (e.g., adding or updating a user) into stored procedures and call these procedures from the application instead of using raw SQL commands.

- **Database Indexing:**
  - Add indexes to frequently queried fields (e.g., `Username`, `Email`) in the `Users` table to speed up read operations and improve overall database performance.
  - Analyze query performance using SQL tools and optimize indexes based on the actual usage patterns.
